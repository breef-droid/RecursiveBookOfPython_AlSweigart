And since (3 × 3 × 3) is the same as 33, we can determine that 36 is the same as (33)2. This is an example of what mathematics calls the power rule: (am)n = amn.

        "Our algorithm keeps reducing n by dividing it in half (if it’s even) or subtracting 1 (if it’s odd) until it is 1. This gives us the squaring or multiply-by-a operations we have to perform. After finishing this step, we perform these operations in reverse order. A generic stack data structure (separate from the call stack) is useful for reversing the order of these operations since it’s a first-in, last-out data structure. The first step pushes squaring or multiply-by-a operations to a stack in the opStack variable. In the second step, it performs these operations as it pops them off the stack.\n",

This means we should subtract 1 from n to get 4 and push a multiply-by-a operation to opStack. Now that n is 4 (even), we divide it by 2 to get 2 and push a squaring operation to opStack. Since n is now 2 and even again, we divide it by 2 to get 1 and push another squaring operation to opStack. Now that n is 1, we are finished with this first step.\n",

We pop the opStack stack to get a squaring operation, telling the program to set result to result * result (that is, result2) or 36. We pop the next operation off opStack, and it is another squaring operation, so the program changes the 36 in result to 36 * 36, or 1296. We pop the last operation off opStack, and it is a multiply-by-a operation, so we multiply the 1296 in result by a (which is 6) to get 7776. There are no more operations on opStack, so the function is now finished. When we double-check our math, we find that 65 is indeed 7,776.\n",

        "You never need to use recursion. No programming problem requires recursion. This chapter has shown that recursion has no magical power to do things that iterative code in a loop with a stack data structure cannot do. In fact, a recursive function might be an overcomplicated solution for what you’re trying to achieve.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, as the exponent functions we created in the previous section show, recursion can provide new insights into how to think about our programming problem. Three features of a programming problem, when present, make it especially suitable to a recursive approach:\n",

        "It involves a tree-like structure.\n",
        "It involves backtracking.\n",
        "It isn’t so deeply recursive as to potentially cause a stack overflow.\n",
        "A tree has a self-similar structure: the branching points look similar to the root of a smaller subtree. Recursion often deals with self-similarity and problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. The root of the tree is analogous to the first call to a recursive function, the branching points are analogous to recursive cases, and the leaves are analogous to the base cases where no more recursive calls are made.\n",

        "A maze is also a good example of a problem that has a tree-like structure and requires backtracking. In a maze, the branching points occur wherever you must pick one of many paths to follow. If you reach a dead end, you’ve encountered the base case. You must then backtrack to a previous branching point to select a different path to follow.<br>\n",

You can take a top-down approach by breaking the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller; this is your recursive case. Then consider when the subproblems are small enough to have a trivial answer; this is your base case. Your recursive function may have more than one recursive case or base case, but all recursive functions will always have at least one recursive case and at least one base case.\n",

We can break the problem of finding a Fibonacci number into the subproblems of finding two smaller Fibonacci numbers. We know the first two Fibonacci numbers are both 1, so that provides the base case answer once the subproblems are small enough.\n",

        "Sometimes it helps to take a bottom-up approach and consider the base case first, and then see how larger and larger problems are constructed and solved from there. The recursive factorial problem is an example. The factorial of 1! is 1. This forms the base case. The next factorial is 2!, and you create it by multiplying 1! by 2. The factorial after that, 3!, is created by multiplying 2! by 3, and so on. From this general pattern, we can figure out what the recursive case for our algorithm will be."
