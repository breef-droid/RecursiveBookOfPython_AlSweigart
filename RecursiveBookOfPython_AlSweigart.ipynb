And since (3 × 3 × 3) is the same as 33, we can determine that 36 is the same as (33)2. This is an example of what mathematics calls the power rule: (am)n = amn.

After finishing this step, we perform these operations in reverse order. A generic stack data structure (separate from the call stack) is useful for reversing the order of these operations since it’s a first-in, last-out data structure. The first step pushes squaring or multiply-by-a operations to a stack in the opStack variable. In the second step, it performs these operations as it pops them off the stack.\n",

We pop the next operation off opStack, and it is another squaring operation, so the program changes the 36 in result to 36 * 36, or 1296. We pop the last operation off opStack, and it is a multiply-by-a operation, so we multiply the 1296 in result by a (which is 6) to get 7776. There are no more operations on opStack, so the function is now finished. When we double-check our math, we find that 65 is indeed 7,776.\n",

This chapter has shown that recursion has no magical power to do things that iterative code in a loop with a stack data structure cannot do. In fact, a recursive function might be an overcomplicated solution for what you’re trying to achieve.\n",

Recursion often deals with self-similarity and problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. The root of the tree is analogous to the first call to a recursive function, the branching points are analogous to recursive cases, and the leaves are analogous to the base cases where no more recursive calls are made.\n",

You can take a top-down approach by breaking the problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller; this is your recursive case.

Your recursive function may have more than one recursive case or base case, but all recursive functions will always have at least one recursive case and at least one base case.\n",

The factorial after that, 3!, is created by multiplying 2! by 3, and so on. From this general pattern, we can figure out what the recursive case for our algorithm will be."
